# Axe Sharpening

A collection of sites, links, and tools. I like to keep my [axe sharp](#a-sharp-axe). This list is by no means exhaustive, but when somebody asks how I keep up I point them here.

I consume most conent with [Feedbin][1], a hosted [open source][2] RSS reader.

### A sharp axe

Many articles add some color to this basic allegory:

Lumberjack B:
> How is it that I worked without breaks, but you cut more wood?

Lumberjack A:
> Because on those breaks I was sharpening my axe.
